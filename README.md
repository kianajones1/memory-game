## Instructions

The point of the game is to try and find each icons matching counterpart.

To do this simply click on a card and it will flip over with a certain design. Once you find a match the cards will remain shown and also change to a different color. While the player is trying to match the cards, a timer, moves counter, and star counter will also be in place.
For every 2 moves made 1 move will be added to the count.
After a preselected amount of moves that are made the player will lose 1 star.
The timer will initate once the player selects the first card and will stop once the all cards have been matched.
At the end of the game (game over) a modal will pop up detailing the players statistics (move counter, star counter, & time). 

These are the methods I used when creating the fundamentals of the game and trying to take the code block by block. The comments in the code show the breakdown of my thought process and when I decided to add each part.
